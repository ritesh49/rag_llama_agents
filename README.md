# RAG Flow with LLaMA Agents

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LLaMA agents. RAG combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to enhance the performance of various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as question answering and conversational agents.

### What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that leverages external information retrieval systems to provide contextually relevant information to a generative model. This approach enhances the model's ability to produce more accurate and contextually appropriate responses by incorporating relevant data retrieved from a knowledge base or document corpus.

### What are LLaMA Agents?

LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) agents refer to large language models developed by Meta AI. These models are designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input they receive. By integrating LLaMA agents into a RAG framework, we can leverage their powerful generative capabilities in conjunction with retrieval mechanisms to improve overall performance.

## Features

- **Retrieval System Integration**: Connects to a retrieval system to fetch relevant information based on user queries.
- **LLaMA Generative Model**: Uses LLaMA agents for generating responses based on the retrieved information.
- **Contextual Responses**: Provides more accurate and contextually relevant responses by combining retrieval and generation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- Access to the LLaMA model via Hugging Face or another provider
